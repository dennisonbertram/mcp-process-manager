# Task 0003: Monitoring and Health Tools Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

## Task Description
Implement comprehensive process monitoring and health check tools for the MCP Process Manager. This includes real-time stats collection, system resource monitoring, health checks with auto-restart capabilities, and 4 MCP tools for accessing monitoring data.

## Success Criteria ✅ ALL MET
- [x] StatsCollector collects process metrics via pidusage library
- [x] System stats collected via node-os-utils library
- [x] Metrics stored in SQLite database with proper schema
- [x] Metrics cache maintains last 100 entries per process
- [x] Health checks execute custom commands with shell-free implementation
- [x] Auto-restart triggers on health failure (optional)
- [x] All 4 monitoring tools implemented and registered via central registry
- [x] Aggregated stats calculated correctly (avg/max CPU/memory)
- [x] PID existence checks work for basic health validation
- [x] Response time tracked for health checks
- [x] MCP compliance: tools/call returns content only
- [x] All tests pass (16 test cases including edge cases)
- [x] Performance metrics met (<50ms per process, <100ms system stats)

## Failure Conditions
- Process metrics collection fails or returns invalid data
- System stats collection throws errors or returns incorrect values
- Health checks don't execute or timeout improperly
- Database operations fail or corrupt data
- MCP tools don't register or respond correctly
- Memory leaks or performance degradation
- Tests fail or don't cover required scenarios

## Edge Cases
- Process dies between health check and stats collection
- Invalid PIDs passed to pidusage
- Health check commands that hang or produce large output
- System with no running processes
- Database corruption or disk space issues
- Network timeouts for external health checks
- Processes with very high CPU/memory usage
- Auto-restart loops causing system instability

## Implementation Checklist ✅ ALL COMPLETE
### Phase 1: Dependencies & Setup ✅
- [x] Install pidusage and node-os-utils packages (already installed)
- [x] Verify package safety and compatibility
- [x] Update package.json with pinned versions
- [x] Test library functionality independently

### Phase 2: StatsCollector Implementation ✅
- [x] Create src/monitoring/collector.ts with StatsCollector class
- [x] Implement process metrics collection using pidusage
- [x] Implement system stats collection using node-os-utils
- [x] Add metrics storage to SQLite database
- [x] Implement metrics cache with 100-entry limit
- [x] Add event emission for metrics collection
- [x] Implement aggregated stats calculation

### Phase 3: HealthCheckService Implementation ✅
- [x] Create src/monitoring/health.ts with HealthCheckService class
- [x] Implement shell-free health check execution
- [x] Add command path validation using allowlist
- [x] Implement PID existence checks
- [x] Add auto-restart functionality with backoff
- [x] Track response times and error handling

### Phase 4: MCP Tools Implementation ✅
- [x] Create src/tools/monitoring.ts
- [x] Implement 4 monitoring tools using central registry
- [x] Add Zod schema validation for all tool inputs
- [x] Ensure MCP compliance (content-only responses)
- [x] Register tools via registry system

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing ✅
- [x] Update src/index.ts to initialize monitoring services
- [x] Create comprehensive tests (tests/monitoring.test.ts)
- [x] Test dead PID handling and error scenarios
- [x] Validate metrics cache caps and JSON schemas
- [x] Run performance benchmarks
- [x] Test MCP tool functionality via stdio

### Phase 6: Documentation & Cleanup ✅
- [x] Update task document with completion status
- [x] Add monitoring examples to documentation
- [x] Run linting and type checking
- [x] Clean up temporary files
- [x] Commit changes with detailed message

## Dependencies
- Task 0001 (Server Setup) - provides server foundation
- Task 0002 (Process Lifecycle) - provides ProcessManager and database schema
- pidusage package for process metrics
- node-os-utils package for system stats

## Testing Strategy
1. **Library Testing**: Verify pidusage and node-os-utils work independently
2. **Unit Testing**: Test each service class in isolation
3. **Integration Testing**: Test services working together
4. **MCP Testing**: Test tools via stdio protocol
5. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark collection speeds and memory usage

## Performance Requirements
- Metric collection: <50ms per process
- System stats: <100ms total
- Health checks: <5s timeout, <10MB output cap
- Stats queries: <10ms for 1000 records
- Memory overhead: <10MB for 50 processes

## Branch Strategy
Create branch: `0003-monitoring-health-tools`
Merge after all success criteria met and tests pass.
